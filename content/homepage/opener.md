I write the weekly posts on [The Apiarist](https://www.theapiarist.org) and offer talks on a range of beekeeping topics during the autumn, winter and early spring. I'm a scientist, so there's usually a bit of lightweight science mixed in with the practical beekeeping. I think that's the best way to know *why* you're doing *what* you're doing.

The following pages contain details of the talks I currently offer, my fees, contact details and the arrangements that seem to work well for online talks. I only talk once a week and the diary gives an indication of my current availability.

I look forward to hearing from you.
