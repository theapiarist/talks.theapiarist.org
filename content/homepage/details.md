Since March 2020 I have only given talks online. These work well and many beekeepers welcome the opportunity to learn something new without having to drive halfway across the county on a cold, wet, winter night. 

I live very remotely but have a fast fibre connection and high quality video and audio setup ... it's not the same as being in the same room, but it is pretty good. 

I get many invitations to talk 'in person'. Although it's flattering to be invited, the distances and time involved are neither practical nor environmentally sustainable. I live over four hours hard driving from Edinburgh or Glasgow (or more if the ferry isn't running) making evening talks unappealing, and weekend events multi-day trips. I live in a beautiful part of the country and would prefer to be here than in the car or an airport.

### Zoom, Teams and GoToMeeting

Of the three, if there's a choice, use Zoom. I've used Zoom and Teams hundreds of times and Zoom is consistently easier to use by the host, the audience and the speaker. The only problems I have encountered with Zoom over the last year were one association that struggled to hook up a room speaker system to their laptop (*i.e.* not a Zoom problem), and another when the association forgot to send me the meeting link before the talk!

Most talks last ~70 minutes and I therefore include a refreshment break. Unlike 'in person' talks you have to provide your own tea and biscuits.

Questions and answers are an important and enjoyable part of the evening (after all, *I've* heard the talk before, but I've not heard *your* questions). For small groups, say less than ~30, questions can be handled by the audience unmuting and asking the question directly. The host usually needs to coordinate this ... a *free for all* does not work. It helps if the audience are familiar with the 'raising the hand' Zoom gesture which makes things a lot easier. 

For larger groups - and I've talked to 350+ - questions  need to be submitted via the 'chat' function. The host then reads questions out, ideally following a bit of sanity checking, ranking them by popularity and weeding out duplicates. 

I'm happy to have a 10 minute pre-meeting with the host to discuss arrangements for the evening if needed. Usually this can be done on the night of the talk.
