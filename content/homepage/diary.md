I give evening and weekend talks between September and March (inclusive) so I have time for my own beekeeping. I can talk any day of the week, but **only once a week** to allow time for my writing, family and other commitments. Current availability is indicated below.

Dates indicated below are all **Mondays** but I can talk *any* day of the week. For convenience, here are [2024](https://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/?year=2024&country=9) and [2025](https://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/?year=2025&country=9) calendars.

I am already fully booked for Spring 2024, *thank you*.
