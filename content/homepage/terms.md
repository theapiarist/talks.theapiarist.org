My fees reflect the popularity and quality of my talks. They also reflect the hours of preparation that goes into producing the photographs and text for the 50-70 'slides' used in the presentation, the investment in audio/video equipment and the background research.

### <a name='fees'></a>Fees

Fees are related to audience size, which are linked to the host association's Zoom licence:

* Up to 100 in attendance - £125 (unchanged since 2021)
* Between 100 and 300 in attendance - £250
* Over 300 - by arrangement in advance

The fees above are for evening talks. Daytime or weekend talks are 20% more as these significantly restrict me doing anything else on the day.

Fees are reviewed annually (at the end of March). I honour the fee applicable on the date the talk is confirmed as booked. 

**Important**: talks cancelled within 6 weeks of an agreed and confirmed date will be invoiced as I will be unlikely to get an alternate booking - associations tend to book 6-12 months in advance. If I am unavailable at short notice (which has happened once in 3 years due to a 48 hour power outage) I will rearrange the talk at the earliest mutually convenient time.

I'm happy to talk to overseas beekeeping associations by arrangement, but please remember that my time zone is GMT (5 hours ahead of New York, 8 hours ahead of Vancouver).

### Talks to multiple associations

To help small associations I am happy for them to invite a neighbouring association and so increase the size of the audience and share the costs of running the talk. This helps avoid the anomaly where large (presumably well-funded) associations were paying signficiantly less per head for attendees at a talk.

If you want to invite a neighbouring association please **ask me in advance** (some of the talks have content customised to a particular location). It makes everyone's life easier if one asociation issues the invitation, sends out the Zoom link and pays the invoice.

### <a name='recordings'></a>Recordings 

Since some association members may not be able to attend 'on the night' I am happy for talks to be recorded with the following restrictions; 

* talks are not shared or accessible on a public website and must only be viewable within the 'members only' (*i.e.* password protected) area of the host association website. For simplicity - and to encourage associations to host talks *and* audiences to attend - if the presentation is to one or more neighbouring associations then *only* the host association can distribute the recording.

* recordings are taken down one calendar year after the date of the talk. Some of the content may be time-sensitive (*e.g.* VMD-approved miticides) and I want the talk you watch to be current and relevant. I also want to be invited again sometime in the future.

### Invoices

I will invoice you following the talk. Payment by BACS only.
