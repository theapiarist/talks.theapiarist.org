                    <p>I write the weekly posts on <a href="https://theapiarist.org">The Apiarist</a> and offer talks on a range of beekeeping topics during the autumn, winter and early spring. I&rsquo;m a retired scientist, so there&rsquo;s usually a bit of lightweight science mixed in with the practical beekeeping. I think that&rsquo;s the best way to know <em>why</em> you&rsquo;re doing <em>what</em> you&rsquo;re doing.</p>
<p>The following pages contain details of the talks I currently offer, my fees, contact details and the arrangements that work well for online talks. I only talk once a week and the diary gives an indication of my current availability.</p>
<p>I look forward to hearing from you.</p>

                <section class="post-content">
                    <p>These are synopses of the talks that I currently offer.</p>
<p>There is a trade-off between the breadth of coverage of a topic and the amount of detail I can reasonably include. For example, a talk on <em>Preparing for Winter</em> will inevitably contain much less detail on why the timing of <em>Varroa</em> control is so critical than my talk on <em>Rational Varroa control</em>, because I also have to discuss woodpeckers, feeding and hefting the hive <em>etc.</em> If you want to know why it&rsquo;s not possible to schedule your <em>Varroa</em> treatments using the calendar you need the detailed talk.</p>
<p>In my experience talks are best appreciated when they &lsquo;fit&rsquo; with the expectations of the audience and the beekeeping season - for example, talks on <em>Varroa</em> control in autumn, talks on DIY in winter and talks on bait hives or queen rearing in early spring.</p>
<h3 id="rational-varroa-control">Rational <em>Varroa</em> control</h3>
<p><img src="images/20141008-0017-2.webp" alt="Deformed wing virus symptoms"></p>
<p><em>Varroa</em> remains the greatest threat to bees and beekeeping. The mite, and the viruses it transmits, are responsible for most overwintering colony losses. To avoid these mite levels must be minimised. This presentation discusses some of the science behind why <em>Varroa</em> and viruses are a threat to our bees before moving on to practical beekeeping considerations including how and when to control <em>Varroa</em> in your hives. Many beekeepers treat at the wrong time of the season, or use the wrong treatment, for maximal effect. In addition to a late summer and midwinter treatment (which should be all that are needed for successful <em>Varroa</em> management) the opportunities to treat in the middle of the season, the importance of managing <em>Varroa</em> in swarms and the strategic, landscape-scale, management of Varroa are also discussed.</p>
<h3 id="bait-hives">Bait hives</h3>
<p><img src="images/130525-161240.webp" alt="Bait hive &hellip; waiting for bees"></p>
<p>This talk covers theoretical and practical aspects of swarms and bait hives. Starting with a brief overview of honey bee colony reproduction I then cover the role of scout bees in identifying a new nest site, the process of swarming, bivouacking and then relocation to the chosen location. After a brief digression into capturing swarms I then discuss setting up bait hives, the choice of box, its location and contents. This covers both scientific studies and how these findings can best be applied to practical beekeeping. Discussion of the contents of the bait hive necessitates another digression into using foundationless frames, which offer particular benefits for bait hives. The talk closes with a discussion of what you can expect to observe when scout bees find and favour your bait hive, and the things you need to do having attracted a swarm – these include moving it somewhere else and managing the <em>Varroa</em> that also arrive with the swarm.</p>
<h3 id="queenright-queen-rearing">Queenright queen rearing</h3>
<p><img src="images/20140521-0005.webp" alt="A full house &hellip; queen cells"></p>
<p>Queen rearing gives both tremendous satisfaction and independence to beekeepers. Loss of a swarm or a queen, or the need to make increase are easily solved if you rear your own queens. Beekeepers can easily rear queens of comparable quality to most commercially raised queens with a little effort. This talk is aimed at beekeepers with a year or two of experience who are interested in rearing a small number of queens each year. It is a gentle introduction to the subject and describes an effective and economical approach that employs methods that can be readily scaled as needs and experience increase. The talk covers the importance of the quality of the starting material – the larvae and drones – and the necessity for good record keeping. It moves on to cover the practicalities of grafting larvae (much easier than most beekeepers realise), cell raising and getting queens mated from nucleus colonies. The talk does not try and cover the myriad of different queen rearing strategies, but instead focuses on methods achievable by beekeepers with as few as 1-3 colonies and limited additional specialist equipment. At the end of the talk there will be a brief overview of teaching practical queen rearing in a beekeeping association – using the same methods, but distributing grafted larvae for cell raising and queen mating.</p>
<h3 id="diy-for-beekeepers">DIY for beekeepers</h3>
<p><img src="images/210117-05.webp" alt="Morris board"></p>
<p>This talk covers topics as diverse as recycled <em>For Sale</em> signs, the number of jars of honey it takes to pay for a Toyota Hilux (and how to move hives slightly more economically), foundationless frames and wasp-resistant hive entrances. It is an entertaining look at some of the things that either aren’t available commercially, or that can be built at home both better and cheaper. None of the items discussed require any specialist, expensive (or even power) tools . . . though a pizza cutter will come in useful. Several of the items described have won prizes in beekeeping shows (for readers of The Apiarist, unfortunately not for me). This is the ideal talk for late autumn or early winter when beekeepers have a little more time on their hands &hellip; it is intended to convince you that the bees don&rsquo;t need fancy woodwork, and to inspire you to build something yourself.</p>
<h3 id="bee-sheds">Bee sheds</h3>
<p><img src="images/180628-020.webp" alt="The bee shed"></p>
<p>In the same way that bee hives provide shelter for the bees, bee sheds or shelters protect the beekeeper and the hives from the elements. Although often seen in continental Europe they are rarely used in the UK. They provide significant advantages in areas with poor weather or for beekeepers who must visit their hives on particular days – for example, due to commitments during the working week that necesitate all inspections are conducted on rainy weekends. My experience with bee sheds has evolved over 6+ years using them to house colonies for scientific research. The talk covers the advantages and disadvantages bee sheds offer and provides advice on what works well (and on some of the failures learnt the hard way!). If the weather forecast says “mainly dry” you know it’s likely to rain, probably as you don your beesuit. This isn’t a problem if you house your bees in a shed.</p>
<h3 id="the-nucleus-option">The nucleus option</h3>
<p><img src="images/190422-004.webp" alt="Overwintered nucleus"></p>
<p>This talk covers choosing and using nucleus hives. I discuss what to look for when purchasing poly nucs and how to prepare them for use. There are a myriad of uses for nucs and I cover the preparation of a nucleus colony, moving (or not moving) it to another apiary, circle splits and the importance of a balanced population of bees, using nucs for swarm control, queen mating and queen rearing, feeding bees in nucs (and feeders), overwintering nucs and selling nucleus colonies. In addition to the use of &lsquo;full size&rsquo; nucs I also discuss using mini-nucs for queen mating, covering some of the designs available, populating mini-nucs with young bees and overwintering colonies in mini-nucs. Although mini-nucs are rather specialised, a standard nucleus hive is arguably one of the most useful and most flexible pieces of beekeeping equipment, and beekeepers should know how to choose and use them.</p>
<h3 id="preparing-for-winter">Preparing for winter</h3>
<p><img src="images/210124-10.webp" alt="Hive in the snow"></p>
<p>Winter is the season when more colonies succumb – to disease, starvation, queen failures or natural disaster – than any other time of the year. In the UK, annual overwintering colony losses are regularly as high as 20-30%. Proper preparation for winter, a process that starts in August, is essential if losses are to be minimised. This talk covers the essential components of that preparation; the features of the bees themselves that aid successful overwintering, the preparation and protection of the hive, feeding the colony in the autumn, and midwinter checks. The second half of the talk focuses on <em>Varroa</em> management in autumn and winter, stressing the key aspects of a rational approach to controlling the mite and the viruses it transmits.</p>
<h3 id="preparing-for-the-season-ahead">Preparing for the season ahead</h3>
<p><img src="images/160818-23.webp" alt="Evening in the apiary"></p>
<p>We know what’s coming in the season ahead, but we’re not quite sure <em>when</em> it will happen. The goal of this talk is to make beekeepers a little more proactive and a bit less reactive. The bees will do whatever they want (as usual!) but with a little preparation the relatively short season can feel a bit less frantic. I cover record keeping, equipment needs, feeding, <em>Varroa</em> management and queen rearing. Inevitably, because of the breadth of topics covered, each gets less attention than it would in a dedicated talk. However, focusing on some of these subjects before the season starts should allow beekeepers to think, plan and prepare for events when they (inevitably) happen.</p>
<p><img src="images/headers/170506-04.webp" alt="Queen"></p>
<h3 id="coming-soon-">Coming soon &hellip;</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping to prepare new talks on queen rearing for 2024/25 &hellip; watch this space.</p>

                <section class="post-content">
                    <p>Since March 2020 I have only given talks online. These work well and many beekeepers welcome the opportunity to learn something new without having to drive halfway across the county on a cold, wet, winter night.</p>
<p>I live very remotely but have a fast fibre connection and high quality video and audio setup &hellip; it&rsquo;s not the same as being in the same room, but it is pretty good.</p>
<p>I get many invitations to talk &lsquo;in person&rsquo;. Although it&rsquo;s flattering to be invited, the distances and time involved are neither practical nor environmentally sustainable. I live over four hours hard driving from Edinburgh or Glasgow (or more if the ferry isn&rsquo;t running) making evening talks unappealing, and weekend events multi-day trips. I live in a beautiful part of the country and would prefer to be here than in the car or an airport.</p>
<h3 id="zoom-teams-and-gotomeeting">Zoom, Teams and GoToMeeting</h3>
<p>Of the three, if there&rsquo;s a choice, use Zoom. I&rsquo;ve used Zoom and Teams hundreds of times and Zoom is consistently easier to use by the host, the audience and the speaker. The only problems I have encountered with Zoom over the last year were one association that struggled to hook up a room speaker system to their laptop (<em>i.e.</em> not a Zoom problem), and another when the association forgot to send me the meeting link before the talk!</p>
<p>Most talks last ~70 minutes and I therefore include a refreshment break. Unlike &lsquo;in person&rsquo; talks you have to provide your own tea and biscuits.</p>
<p>Questions and answers are an important and enjoyable part of the evening (after all, <em>I&rsquo;ve</em> heard the talk before, but I&rsquo;ve not heard <em>your</em> questions). For small groups, say less than ~30, questions can be handled by the audience unmuting and asking the question directly. The host usually needs to coordinate this &hellip; a <em>free for all</em> does not work. It helps if the audience are familiar with the &lsquo;raising the hand&rsquo; Zoom gesture which makes things a lot easier.</p>
<p>For larger groups - and I&rsquo;ve talked to 350+ - questions  need to be submitted via the &lsquo;chat&rsquo; function. The host then reads questions out, ideally following a bit of sanity checking, ranking them by popularity and weeding out duplicates.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to have a 10 minute pre-meeting with the host to discuss arrangements for the evening if needed. Usually this can be done on the night of the talk.</p>

<li>Over 300 - by arrangement in advance</li>
</ul>
<p>The fees above are for evening talks. Daytime or weekend talks are 20% more as these significantly restrict me doing anything else on the day.</p>
<p>Fees are reviewed annually (at the end of March). I honour the fee applicable on the date the talk is confirmed as booked.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: talks cancelled within 6 weeks of an agreed and confirmed date will be invoiced as I will be unlikely to get an alternate booking - associations tend to book 6-12 months in advance. If I am unavailable at short notice (which has happened once in 3 years due to a 48 hour power outage) I will rearrange the talk at the earliest mutually convenient time.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy to talk to overseas beekeeping associations by arrangement, but please remember that my time zone is GMT (5 hours ahead of New York, 8 hours ahead of Vancouver).</p>
<h3 id="talks-to-multiple-associations">Talks to multiple associations</h3>
<p>To help small associations I am happy for them to invite a neighbouring association and so increase the size of the audience and share the costs of running the talk. This helps avoid the anomaly where large (presumably well-funded) associations were paying signficiantly less per head for attendees at a talk.</p>
<p>If you want to invite a neighbouring association please <strong>ask me in advance</strong> (some of the talks have content customised to a particular location). It makes everyone&rsquo;s life easier if one asociation issues the invitation, sends out the Zoom link and pays the invoice.</p>
<h3 id="a-namerecordingsarecordings"><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Recordings</h3>
<p>Since some association members may not be able to attend &lsquo;on the night&rsquo; I am happy for talks to be recorded with the following restrictions;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>talks are not shared or accessible on a public website and must only be viewable within the &lsquo;members only&rsquo; (<em>i.e.</em> password protected) area of the host association website. For simplicity - and to encourage associations to host talks <em>and</em> audiences to attend - if the presentation is to one or more neighbouring associations then <em>only</em> the host association can distribute the recording.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>recordings are taken down one calendar year after the date of the talk. Some of the content may be time-sensitive (<em>e.g.</em> VMD-approved miticides) and I want the talk you watch to be current and relevant. I also want to be invited again sometime in the future.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="invoices">Invoices</h3>
<p>I will invoice you following the talk. Payment by BACS only.</p>

<h3 id="david-evans-the-apiaristhttpstheapiaristorg">David Evans (<a href="https://theapiarist.org">The Apiarist</a>)</h3>
<p>David Evans is Emeritus Professor of Virology in the School of Biology, University of St. Andrews. His research interests included the replication and evolution of human and animal viruses, and the biology and control of both Deformed wing virus (DWV) and Chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV) of honey bees.</p>
<h4 id="research-topics-include">Research topics include:</h4>
<ul>
<li>the evolution of RNA viruses</li>
<li>replication of DWV in honey bees, <em>Varroa</em> and non-<em>Apis</em> pollinators</li>
<li>rational <em>Varroa</em> control at the landscape scale</li>
<li>the biology of CBPV, an emerging pathogen of honey bees</li>
</ul>
<p>Studies of honey bee viruses involved collaborations with groups in the Universities of Aberdeen (Alan Bowman) and Newcastle (Giles Budge), with the Science and Advice Service for Scottish Agriculture (SASA), and with several beekeeping associations.</p>
<p>David held previous academic positions at the Universities of Reading, Glasgow and Warwick, conducting research on HIV, HCV and poliovirus with extensive grant support from UK Research Councils and charities. He published well over 100 peer-reviewed publications and supervised more than 30 PhD. students.</p>
<p>David is an enthusiastic beekeeper – an activity that pre-dates his research on honey bee viruses by several years – and a member of Fife Beekeepers, the East of Scotland BKA and Lochaber BKA. He runs about twenty colonies and is particularly interested in queen rearing and <em>‘pottering in the shed with bits of wood and a nail gun’</em>.</p>
<p>His interest in DIY for beekeeping resulted in a regular column in the Warwick and Leamington Beekeepers newsletter <em>Bee Talk</em> which, over time, evolved into his personal beekeeping website <a href="https://theapiarist.org">The Apiarist</a>. On this he covers topics as diverse as <em>Varroa</em> management, responsible mentoring, the price of honey and practical waspkeeping. New posts appear every Friday afternoon and he regularly discusses recent scientific advances on the biology of honey bees. The popularity of the website has resulted in numerous invitations to talk at local, national and international beekeeping meetings.</p>
<p>David now lives on the remote west coast of Scotland in one of the few remaining parts of mainland UK that is <em>Varroa</em> free.</p>
